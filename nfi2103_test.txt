- Terminal output of nfi2103-decisionTree.cpp when file restaurant2_train.csv (provided on Courseworks) is used as both training and test data. Note the last attribute of each row agrees with the classification provided in the training data in almost all cases (it doesn't for "Some Yeah Yeah Nope $ Nope Burger 0-10 Maybe  ==> Yes"). This is not, however, a mistake. For this given training data set, I have observed that at some point function MaxImportance finds that all remaining attributes among which one must be chosen to split the data on provide zero gain and so MaxImportance makes an arbitrary choice of which attribute to split on. The difference in the results is due to this arbitrary choice. In other words, this is the best we can do.
